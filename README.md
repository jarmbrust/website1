# Welcome to my personal website!

This site is written in Vue 3, Typescript, Mongodb, and is hosted serverless on Netlify with nodejs.
State management is through Pinia.
Unit and component tests will be expanded upon with vitest as well.

If you have any questions, please let me know!

The url for the site is: 
``` james3k.com ```

If you would like to login with the "guest" account, which won't give you much in the 
way of access, but will alow you to see the flow, the password is ```S*mpL3pass```.

There are a few more things I want to fix-up or implement.
Some of them are (in no particular order):

- [ ] more tests.
- [ ] format blog post input (might need a package).
- [ ] edit existing blog posts.
- [ ] create a "portfolio" section.

...and more as I think of it.
