    <h1>Resume</h1>
    <p>You are logged in with the correct permissions and would be able to see my resume.
      However, I have not yet entered it into the site.  In any case, if you were able to login,
      chances are you have a copy of my resume already.  If not, and you would like a copy, please contact me!</p>
    <p>Feel free to checkout out my Github account which has the code for this site.
      You can find the code here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jarmbrust/website1">Github</a>.</p>
