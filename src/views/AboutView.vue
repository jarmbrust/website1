    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is James, and I live in Colorado with my loving wife and our 2 dogs, 3 cats, and a small assortment of other critters.</p>
    <p>My career is in software development, with a background in frontend, backend, and database procedures.  My current focus is on the frontend, but I am flexible moving forward.
       My hobbies include writing, sketching, pottery, TTRPGs, and I enjoy reading or watching (sometimes really bad) scifi and fantasy books and movies.</p>
    <p>In fact, the name of this website is in part a homage to the TV show Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3k for short).
       It is a show where the characters make fun of really bad movies under the pretense of being trapped in a science experiment while in a space station orbiting... The moon I think?  ...It was never really made clear.
       Regardless, I used to watch that show all the time with my mother as a child, and still have a fondness for it today.</p>
